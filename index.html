            <p>Good evening, Mister Reaper. You've been summoned on behalf of the clergy for a mini Thanksgiving classroom special, featuring me hard-coding every feature I've learned in this dumbass udemy course.</p>
            <p>You know when you were in grade school and you would get like vaguely Thanksgiving-related activities</p>
            <p>They'd make you like sing a pilgrim song or reflect on what you're thankful for</p>
            <p>If this was a private school only thing that would be embarrassing</p>
            <p>But it kinda makes sense because we'd have a Thanksgiving masss...and the each grade had their own niche</p>
            <p>And a rite of passage was like the 4th grade had to perform a song and we'd have to practice literally during class</p>
            <p>It's such a weird...niche memory and the ONLY EVIDENCE besides maybe family home video recordings is this almost uncanny video I found on youtube</p>
            <iframe

                allowfullscreen>
            </iframe>
            <p>I hope you enjoyed that. The comments on the video make my experience feel valid.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Anyways, besides hand turkeys, that one year they made us make cranberry sauce, and dressing up as pilgrims and NAs /they definitely don't do that anymore lmao/ another activity they would encourage us to do is write poems.</p>
            <p>Particularly, poems on what we're thankful for</p>
            <p>That's highkey corny as fuck so I took the liberty of adding some twists </p>
            <p>Feel free to click on a button, or two, or many</p>
