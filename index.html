            <p>Good evening, Mister Reaper. You've been summoned on behalf of the clergy for a mini Thanksgiving classroom special, featuring me hard-coding every feature I've learned in this dumbass udemy course.</p>
            <p>You know when you were in grade school and you would get like vaguely Thanksgiving-related activities</p>
            <p>They'd make you like sing a pilgrim song or reflect on what you're thankful for</p>
            <p>If this was a private school only thing that would be embarrassing</p>
            <p>But it kinda makes sense because we'd have a Thanksgiving masss...and the each grade had their own niche</p>
            <p>And a rite of passage was like the 4th grade had to perform a song and we'd have to practice literally during class</p>
            <p>It's such a weird...niche memory and the ONLY EVIDENCE besides maybe family home video recordings is this almost uncanny video I found on youtube</p>
            <iframe 
                width="560" height="315" 
                src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vt4PjQHlm3w" 
                title="YouTube video player" 
                frameborder="0" 
                allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" 
                allowfullscreen>
            </iframe>
            <p>I hope you enjoyed that. The comments on the video make my experience feel valid.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Anyways, besides hand turkeys, that one year they made us make cranberry sauce, and dressing up as pilgrims and NAs /they definitely don't do that anymore lmao/ another activity they would encourage us to do is write poems.</p>
            <p>Particularly, poems on what we're thankful for</p>
            <p>That's highkey corny as fuck so I took the liberty of adding some twists </p>
            <p>Feel free to click on a button, or two, or many</p>

                        a haiku this was<br>
                        but i got carried away<br>
                        too many gushy words<br>
                        <br>
                        I couldn't count the reasons I'm thankful for you. <br>
                        There's probably infinite,<br>
                        But if we wanted to try we'd be on facetime for a few hours.<br>
                        We already know all the main things, I say it all the time. <br>
                        But what about the little things? <br>
                        I'm thankful for the tickle monster <br>
                        The matches my energy<br>
                        hmph and grumph<br>
                        Indulges in my retarded tangents and pointless thoughts<br>
                        the silly monster<br>
                        Who was singing slightly wrong song refrains within the first week<br>
                        And baa's back to my meow's<br>
                        (She's got the eyes of a panther)<br>
                        The squeezes me tight monster<br>
                        The one who loves silently snuggling in the dark or randomly in the day<br>
                        Who can tell how I'm feeling just by how tightly I hold his hand<br>
                        And hugs me in the night when we move around and inch closer together<br>
                        The Einstein<br>
                        He's no old man, but we sure act like it sometimes<br>
                        Einstein for his intelligence, his wit, his charm<br>
                        The sweet treat king<br>
                        Who has the discipline to moderate his health<br>
                        But isn't afraid to ask for dessert at the restaurant<br>
                        And pleasures in the physical and non-physical treats life gives<br>
                        A sunset over a flowing creek, a kiss in a crowded area, when geno smith doesn't throw a pick<br>
                        Ruling over his kingdom<br>
                        And I sit at the palace<br>
                        I daydream about a ball<br>
                        The Disney ones like in Cinderella<br>
                        Where you meet me at the bottom of the stairs<br>
                        And take my gloved hand and we dance (the night away) into the night<br>
                        See...now I'm rambling. <br>

                        ok, clearly there's some funky stuff with the buttons that I couldn't totally figure out on time<br>
                        but I didn't want to keep you waiting for this any more days<br>
                        I promised you way back when that I'd have a reaper webpage up and running eventually<br>
                        You've always inspired me to push to be the best version of myself<br>
                        To recognize my worth and stand up for myself and not forsake my capabilities<br>
                        To never stop living life and finding beauty in every thing<br>
                        And it's not just because we talk about it<br>
                        But it's because YOU embody those things<br>
                        Call me your not so secret admirer<br>
                        Or your personal cheerleader<br>
                        (innocent cheerleader gets punished by coach in locker room after missing practice)<br>
                        Ok sorry intrusive thought<br>
                        I love you so much<br>
                        Of fucking course I am thankful for you, I've been since the day we waltzed into each other's lives<br>
                        But it doesn't have to be thanksgiving for me to say that<br>
