    <main>
        <p> I hate chipwiches. 
            Maybe it's because I was never a big cookie fan.
            When you're little, you only learn how to make the instant ones. They were ok at best.
            Instant cookies, instant brownies. 
            Precise measurements, no substitutes or extras.
            It teaches a 6 year old to follow instructions.
            I baked cookies with my mom once; sugar cookies, for my uncle's Christmas party in Franklin Lakes.
            I didn't like them, but they were fun to make. 
            We were more of a brownie family.

            I continued to sideline cookies. 
            I don't think I had ever eaten a cookie that truly stood out to me.
            Occasionally enjoying an Oreo (with milk) or a soft-baked Chips Ahoy didn't suffice.
            On a good day my mom would pack 2 Pepperidge Farms Captiva cookies in my lunchbox.
            The best days would be when my friends and I had Cosmic Brownies in our boxes,
            and we would bid to see how the pieces would be split.

            Cookie skillet kits were overlooked on Christmas checklists
            And I'd eliminate cookies on social media's "You can only remove one,"
            Yet I'd acquired quite a few cutters (my favorite are the Disney ones).
            I learned to make gingerbread men when I was much older,
            But I would only roughly consider those cookies.

            After I met you, cookies became different.
            I found myself salivating at the sight of a cookie skillet under vanilla icecream,
            Adding a Crumbl widget to my laptop despite never eating a single cookie,
            And sitting under the hot summer sun, eating an icecream sandwich with you from Insomnia.
            Icecream sandwiched between two huge cookies...
            No one could have prepared me for that (not even myself, because I could barely finish it).

            Now you think this is going in that direction.
            The part where I say you are the cookie that opened my eyes to new cookie horizons.
            No, that's not where I was going with that.

            Life is so much *sweeter* when I see you smile. 
            Nothing makes me giggle more than seeing your excitement before the first bite of a treat.
            My sweet tooth for you knows no bounds.
            
            In fairness, you also did open my eyes to new cookie horizons
            To see how sweet life can truly be.
            To be afraid of the unknown
            And despite not knowing, to enjoy every step anyway.
            Life may not be sweet every second.
            But if it was... the world would probably be in a constant state of queasiness.

            In my head, I'm the cookie.
            Sidelining myself in my own head, tracked to follow the instructions
            Of the media I consumed and the constructs the world made me believe.
            But you saw me and loved me. 
            A cookie with a recipe like no other.

            So what about the chipwich? 
            I still hate them. Basic, stale, in the freezer at the market for weeks.
            But there's more than just the chipwich with freezer burn at the store.
            The soft-baked, warm yet sturdy cookie base 
            Juxtaposed with the cold yet creamy flavor of ice cream to match.
            A fluffy delight, to customize and enjoy. 
            A unique experience every time, but always delicious, especially when shared with you.
            
            The universe goes far beyond than the dry and rock-solid chipwich in the freezer.
            You make it a whole lot sweeter.
