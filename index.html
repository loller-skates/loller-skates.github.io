    <main>
        <p> I hate chipwiches. <br>
            Maybe it's because I was never a big cookie fan. <br>
            When you're little, you only learn how to make the instant ones. They were ok at best. <br>
            Instant cookies, instant brownies. <br>
            Precise measurements, no substitutes or extras. <br>
            It teaches a 6 year old to follow instructions. <br>
            I baked cookies with my mom once; sugar cookies, for my uncle's Christmas party in Franklin Lakes. <br>
            I didn't like them, but they were fun to make. <br>
            We were more of a brownie family. <br>
            <br>
            I continued to sideline cookies. <br>
            I don't think I had ever eaten a cookie that truly stood out to me. <br>
            Occasionally enjoying an Oreo (with milk) or a soft-baked Chips Ahoy didn't suffice. <br>
            On a good day my mom would pack 2 Pepperidge Farms Captiva cookies in my lunchbox. <br>
            The best days would be when my friends and I had Cosmic Brownies in our boxes, <br>
            and we would bid to see how the pieces would be split. <br>
            <br>
            Cookie skillet kits were overlooked on Christmas checklists <br>
            And I'd eliminate cookies on social media's "You can only remove one," <br>
            Yet I'd acquired quite a few cutters (my favorite are the Disney ones). <br>
            I learned to make gingerbread men when I was much older, <br>
            But I would only roughly consider those cookies. <br>
            <br>
            After I met you, cookies became different. <br>
            I found myself salivating at the sight of a cookie skillet under vanilla icecream, <br>
            Adding a Crumbl widget to my laptop despite never eating a single cookie, <br>
            And sitting under the hot summer sun, eating an icecream sandwich with you from Insomnia. <br>
            Icecream sandwiched between two huge cookies... <br>
            No one could have prepared me for that (not even myself, because I could barely finish it). <br>
            <br>
            Now you think this is going in that direction. <br>
            The part where I say you are the cookie that opened my eyes to new cookie horizons. <br>
            No, that's not where I was going with that. <br>
            <br>
            Life is so much *sweeter* when I see you smile. <br>
            Nothing makes me giggle more than seeing your excitement before the first bite of a treat. <br>
            My sweet tooth for you knows no bounds. <br>
            <br>
            In fairness, you also did open my eyes to new cookie horizons <br>
            To see how sweet life can truly be. <br>
            To be afraid of the unknown <br>
            And despite not knowing, to enjoy every step anyway. <br>
            Life may not be sweet every second. <br>
            But if it was... the world would probably be in a constant state of queasiness. <br>
            <br>
            In my head, I'm the cookie.
            Sidelining myself in my own head, tracked to follow the instructions <br>
            Of the media I consumed and the constructs the world made me believe. <br>
            But you saw me and loved me. <br>
            A cookie with a recipe like no other. <br>
            <br>
            So what about the chipwich? 
            I still hate them. Basic, stale, in the freezer at the market for weeks. <br>
            But there's more than just the chipwich with freezer burn at the store. <br>
            The soft-baked, warm yet sturdy cookie base <br>
            Juxtaposed with the cold yet creamy flavor of ice cream to match. <br>
            A fluffy delight, to customize and enjoy. <br>
            A unique experience every time, but always delicious, especially when shared with you. <br>
            <br>
            The universe goes far beyond than the dry and rock-solid chipwich in the freezer. <br>
            You make it a whole lot sweeter. <br>
