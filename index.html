            <p>Good evening, Mr. Blitz. Se√±or Blitz. Se√±or Reaper. Reaper. Mr. Reaper. goob ball</p>
            <p>On behalf of the P Association, you've been summoned before this very tasty and delicious, whipped cream on top prosecutioner</p>
            <p>To find you guilty, guilty of stealing my heart</p>
            <p>The range of punishments...can be...oh so spicy.............spiccceeeeeee </p>
            <p>The punishment for doing so is... eating them.</p>
            <p>The sweethearts, that is. The Valentine's day candy. Except I will say, I think they taste pretty good actually I could eat those casually.</p>
            <p>There's a heart underneath here as well, but you can't eat this one either!</p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>

            <p>Yep. I figured out how to host my own images online. Not sure the safety of that, but it worked!</p>
            <p>So, oh, my fairest soul that doth set mine heart ablaze</p>
            <p>Thou dost not hear the lamentations of mine enraptured spirit to your radiance?</p>
            <p>Be thou mine Valentine, or let me perish silently gashed upon the sword of woes</p>

            <p>Anyways, remember when I asked you that question about making spotify playlists?</p>
            <p>Well, I've been looking through youtube accounts I had when I was a kid to find lost songs or nostalgic bits I can transfer to spotify</p>
            <p>I found a couple chronically online songs that unlocked memories, but I also found something that was tbh swept from my memory</p>
            <p>It was privated and I swapped it to unlisted so the HTML could read the link, but I had to PUBLISH IT OFFICIALLY for it to load.</p>
            <p>circa 2015...welcome</p>

            <p>I'm sure it was great. I'm just gonna believe it is.</p>
            <p>It reminds me of a very very low budget version of the Bridge</p>
